# class_website_template

 A template I use for making class websites with the [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) static site generator. It uses [pelican-bootstrap3](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/pelican-bootstrap3) for its theme and [bigfoot.js](http://www.bigfootjs.com) for footnotes. It is also set to use [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/README.html) and [emacs org-mode](http://orgmode.org) files as processor and input, respectively. These can be easily changed though. Note that this template does not include any pelican plugins. These would need to be [downloaded](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins) separately.
